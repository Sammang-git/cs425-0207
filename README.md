Chan Tai Man - 12345678
Welcome to the starter codebase for the **Software Engineering and Project Management** assignment. This project provides a functional, Dockerized web application for grading student assignments. Its purpose is to allow you to focus on project management rather than building a system from scratch.

Project Overview

This starter kit is a basic PHP, MySQL, and HTML/CSS application that simulates an online assignment grading platform. It comes with a pre-built RESTful API, a database schema, and a user interface for two main roles: **Instructors** and **Students**.

Core Features
Dockerized Environment: A fully containerized setup using Docker Compose for easy, consistent deployment across all machines. Docker provides a consistent, isolated environment. This is the preferred method.

Access the Application:
    Once the script finishes, the application will be running. 
    - **Web Application:** [http://localhost:8080]
    - **Database Admin (phpMyAdmin):** [http://localhost:8081]
